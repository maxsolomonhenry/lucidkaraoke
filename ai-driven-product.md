# AI-Driven Product Ownership: A Manifesto

The idea of accelerating audio product development with AI has stuck in my mind since our interview. It's an integuing puzzle with huge potential gains, and it's made of sticky sub-problems that make for a fascinating challenge.

I've prepared a few thoughts for you below, which might go a greater distance to explain how I might approach this problem, as well as a proof of concept project

## Problem Statement

1. How do you leverage LLMs to put _highly-functional_ audio prototypes in the hands of users as early and fast as possible, allowing for feedback and rapid iteration to hone the value proposition and shapen the user need, while:

1. (_Audio criterion_) Ensuring a _stable_ audio backend that delivers an experience that is as close as possible to the product vision, for high-quality user feedback.  This kind of feedback is impossible with traditional wire-framing tools.
    * __The anwer is JUCE__: This C++ framework provides an excellent foundation, with a highly flexible UI and a robust audio engine.

1. (_Efficiency criterion_) Leveraging the generated code to save on dev work down the line: designing an architecture that scales, and a codebase that can be easily maintained and augmented by devs, while leveraging as much of the generated code as possible. And most inportantly:
    * The answer is feedback sessions, early and often, with an _architect_. Programming in a well-known audio dev paradigm (JUCE) ensures you're speaking the _lingua franca_ of DSP engineers, which they can grab and scale.

1. __The human angle (conviviality)__: Perhaps the most interesting challenge, how to work collaboratively with devs, architects and designers, getting __buy-in__, providing __time-saving without over-stepping__; how to define a project that all stakeholders can build out and have a sense of ownership of. 
    * Collaborative brainstorming sessions (1h)  with developers is key, moving from the architecture phase into the development phase. 

### Collaboration is Key
__Collaborative brainstorming__ with subject matter experts (SMEs) is key to alignment and buy-in. As a Product Owner, it is crucial to be curious and humble, to allow devs to find errors and shortcomings, to define a solution together. This guarantees that solutions, once implemented in regular sprints, will come from a place of ownership and understanding

## Proposed Workflow

## Notes

<!-- Intro -- sticky problem that is stuck in my mind, had to work it through very exxciting challenge. -->

For codebase mention work in progress and have a to-do prominently listed with come already completed steps

<!-- Problem 1
- rapid prototyping and get early user feedback with audio is difficult, doesn't work like with wireframes etc

Problem 2
- build out a framework that saves on scalability and leverages developers and Llama at the same time

Problem 3
- define the value add of Product, vis a vis architecture, implementation, user value.

Problem 4
- how to work collaboratively with devs, not overstep, get buy-in and make sure to build something they can build out and have ownership of. -->

<!-- Help define user value, identify need,  -->

Propose workflow:
- Build out audio experience.
- User feedback on audio experience
- Developer / architect feedback on data pipeline (depends on company workflow and culture)
- Both can be used for iteration.
- Architecture can be used for modularization of purpose... build out documents (from architect etc) that feed back into Claude Code and build up documentation .
- Iterare and bring to scale -- devs then help to build into larger infrastrcture and for scaling.

Transitional phase of learning etc. but iteration is key.

Roadmap:
Incubation period (portability) --> Scale
Microsprints (feature build out, modularity, functional structure) --> sprints, infrastructure, etc.

Portability should be on the order of Figma: portable enough to run on other people's computers with minimal setup, but can make some shortcuts when it comes to scalabliltiy on the back-end.

* Proof of concept -- JUCE project for karaoke (put what is implemented and what not, and the placeholder for voice conversion and explain the pipeline)
â€¢ Concrete example of how this would work out with devs and sprints, what the user stories and PRD would look like (mini/micro).

Where to put this? In a github page, and what do you provide in the e-mail? Naybe the high level plan.
